1. Database Connection: All files will need to connect to the same graph database. The connection parameters (like database name, host, port, username, password) will be shared across all files.

2. EV Data Model: The structure of the EV data (i.e., the nodes and relationships in the graph database) will be defined in "ev_data_model.py" and used in "database_setup.py", "ev_data_insertion.py", and "ev_query.py". This includes the names of the nodes (like "ElectricVehicle") and properties (like "Range", "List Price", "Battery Size").

3. Example Data: The example EV data to be inserted into the database will be defined in "ev_data_insertion.py" and used in "database_setup.py".

4. Query Function: The function to run a query on the database will be defined in "ev_query.py" and used in "app.py". The name of this function will be shared.

5. Print Function: The function to print the result of a query will be defined in "app.py". The name of this function will be shared.

6. Message Names: Any messages or prompts displayed to the user (like "Enter your query:" or "The result is:") will be defined in "app.py" and potentially used in other files.

7. Error Handling: Any error messages or exceptions will be defined and used across all files. This includes the names of the exceptions (like "DatabaseConnectionError" or "InvalidQueryError").

8. Import Statements: All files will need to import the necessary Python libraries (like py2neo for interacting with the graph database). The names of these libraries will be shared across all files.
