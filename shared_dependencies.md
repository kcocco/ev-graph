1. Dependencies: These are the libraries that will be used across the files. They include Python's built-in libraries and third-party libraries such as `py2neo` for interacting with the graph database, `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis, and `jupyter` for the notebook.

2. EV Model: This is the data schema that will be shared across the files. It will define the properties of an Electric Vehicle such as Range, List Price, Battery Size, etc.

3. Graph Database Connection: This is the connection to the graph database that will be shared across the files. It will be used to store and retrieve data.

4. Example Data: This is the sample data that will be used to populate the graph database. It will be shared across the files.

5. Query Function: This is the function that will be used to run queries on the graph database. It will be shared across the files.

6. Print Function: This is the function that will be used to print the results of the queries. It will be shared across the files.

7. Notebook: This is the Jupyter notebook that will contain all the code. It will import and use the functions and data from the other files.

Note: As this is a Python-based project, there are no DOM elements, message names, or exported variables involved.
